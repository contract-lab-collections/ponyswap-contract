# PonySwap-contract

Welcome to the PonySwap repository! This decentralized exchange is built on the Ethereum blockchain and enables users to trade various ERC20 tokens.

## Features
- Automated market-making (AMM) algorithm for liquidity provision
- ERC20 token swapping
- Pool creation and management
- User-friendly interface
- Low fees

## Getting Started
To use PonySwap, you will need an Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask. Once you have a wallet set up, you can access the exchange through the PonySwap website.

## How it Works
PonySwap uses an automated market-making algorithm to enable users to trade ERC20 tokens. Users can either swap tokens directly or provide liquidity to pools in exchange for a share of the pool's trading fees.
